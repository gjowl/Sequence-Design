This directory contains all of the analysis that I did for my committee meeting. I have a copy of the reconstructionAllData.csv files
from the ngsReconstruction of CHIP2 as an input file, which is then used to analyze the fluorescence data 
(found in CHIP2/fluorescenceAnalysis). I also have analysis of the clashing mutants, GASrights, and a rerun of pdbBBRepack 
(backbone optimization code) for my structures.

I moved these directories around on 2023-9-5, so if they stop working for some reason, go back to a couple of commits on github 
before that to figure out why.

Directories:
 - fluorescenceAnalysis: contains all of the analysis of the fluorescence data
 - pdbOptimizationAnalysis: contains all of the analysis of the pdbBBRepack rerun
 - clashingAnalysis: contains analysis and code for determining the clashing mutants
 - sequenceAnalysis: contains analysis and code for analyzing the sequence data
