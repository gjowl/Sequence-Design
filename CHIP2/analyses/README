This directory contains all of the analysis that I did for my paper.

These can be run individually based on the configs found in each directory, or they can mostly be run through the runAllAnalysis.py script.

Directories:
 - toxgreenConversion: converts the reconstructed fluorescence data to TOXGREEN fluorescence
 - pdbOptimizationAnalysis: contains all of the analysis of the pdbBBRepack rerun
 - sequenceAnalysis: contains analysis and code for analyzing the mutant vs design sequence data
 - hbondAnalysis: contains analysis and code for analyzing the hydrogen bond data (not part of runAllAnalysis.py)
 - structureAnalysis: contains analysis for structures done on 2024-2 (not part of runAllAnalysis.py)
 - clusterAnalysis: contains analysis for clustering the designs, data not used (not part of runAllAnalysis.py)
