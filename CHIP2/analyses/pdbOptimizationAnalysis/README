This set of scripts and data is used to analyze the data between fluorescence from CHIP2 and the predicted energetic data from the
backbone optimizer script pdbBBRepack. I ran a comparison between my design data and the backbone optimized structures, which seems
to show that the backbone optimization is working well in terms of improving the predicted energies.

As of 2023-9-5, I have not updated all of the energy data with all structures, so currently the all files are just most of the structures.
