This set of scripts and data is used to analyze the data between fluorescence from CHIP2 and the predicted energetic data from the
backbone optimizer script pdbBBRepack. I ran a comparison between my design data and the backbone optimized structures, which seems
to show that the backbone optimization is working well in terms of improving the predicted energies.
