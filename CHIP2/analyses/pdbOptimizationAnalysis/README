This set of scripts and data is used to analyze the data between fluorescence from CHIP2 and the predicted energetic data from the
backbone optimizer script pdbBBRepack. I ran a comparison between my design data and the backbone optimized structures, which seems
to show that the backbone optimization is working well in terms of improving the predicted energies.

If you need instruction on how to run any of these scripts, run:
python3 <script_name>.py -h

There will be a help message that will explain the input arguments and how to run the script.
