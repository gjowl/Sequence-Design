This contains outputs for the pdbOptimizationAnalysis code. It extracts the energetics from a C++ program that predicts
structures of mutant proteins based on a given dimeric pdb structure. The analysis for those energies, according to the 
below given options, is found within this directory. Directories named as follows:
    - clash: trim by the clashing mutant data
    - mutant_cutoff: fluorescence cutoff that the mutant must be less than to accept
    - percent_cutoff: another cutoff for mutants where the mutant fluorescence must be at least this much less than the WT to be accepted
    - number_of_mutants: the number of mutants necessary to be accepted for the WT design to be accepted
