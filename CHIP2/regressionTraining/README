Phil Romero thought it would be a good idea to try and train my data on each of the individual sets of data,
especially since we seem to see pretty good correlation in the GASright region but not within the other regions.
By training, we may be able to make stronger conclusions, and it may give us a better understanding of ways to 
look at the rest of my data (specifically void mutants, as currently the clashing data only analyzes about 33% of the dataset).
