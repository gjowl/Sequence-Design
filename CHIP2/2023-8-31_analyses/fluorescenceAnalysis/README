The original CHIP2 fluorescence range was quite small (~10000 RFU). Because of this, I've adjusted the fluorescence
range using a correlation between the fluorescence of control sequences in CHIP2 and other runs. 

Important notes:
This data is currently not maltose filtered, and the right handed and GASright data is only using replicates 2 and 3.
I have the data from replicate 1 as well, but because the sequencing for bin2 for each of these was done separately and
it sequenced much better, there is a discrepancy in the counts between this and the other bins for this replicate. This 
doesn't seem to be something that the analysis for sort-seq takes into consideration. For now not an issue as I may have to 
re-sort anyways.
The cutoffs used in this data for now are arbitrary. In a future version of this analyzed data, would be nice to have a 
way to pick out the cutoffs based on the data itself.

Correlation directories:
 - analysis_with_our_flow: based on the flow fluorescence of the control sequences that Josh ran on 2023-08-17
 - analysis_with_our_flow_no2H11: same as above, but removing 2H11 which was a slight outlier in the flow
 - analysis_with_SMA_flow: based on the flow fluorescence of the control sequences that Samantha had data for from 
  her 100 sequence run (researchDrive/General/data/data07/sanderson/methodsPaper)
 - analysis_with_toxgreenSeqs: based on the flow fluorescence of controls sequences that Emma ran in toxgreen and the WT
  designs that I ran in toxgreen
 - analysis_with_toxgreenSeqs_percentGpA: same as above, but using percent GpA instead of fluorescence (used for 
  2023-8-31 committee meeting)
 - GASright analysis: data analysis for Josh on just the GASright designs
   - percentGpA: the most relevant data using percentGpA from controls from Emma's toxgreen run and WT designs from toxgreen

Directory structure:
 - filtered: contains data filtered removing any sequences with a standard deviation > ~15% GpA (arbitrary cutoff)
 - sequenceVsMutant: uses the filtered data to extract out different files to be analyzed and graphed
    - _percent_mutants_lessThan_ : contains the percent of mutants that are less than the given percentWT value
    - x_less/x_more/x_wt: contains the sequences with x as a mutant that are less than/more than/around
     the given percentWT value that have
    - all: contains all sequences that are less than/more than/around the given percentWT value
    - all_seqDiff_x: contains sequences that have x or less amino acids different than the wt sequence, allowing direct
     comparison of wt sequences that are similar to each other and treating them as mutants
    - above 110/125: contains sequences that have percent WT above these numbers
    - below 75/90: contains sequences that have percent WT below these numbers
    - between 75-125/90-110: contains sequences that have percent WT between these numbers
    - clash/clash_less/clash_wt: keeps only sequences where a clash mutant was also found/clash less 
     fluorescence than WT/around WT(clash and void mutants defined in the mutation input file)
    - void/void_less/void_wt: keeps only sequences where a void mutant was also found/void less 
     fluorescence than WT/around WT(clash and void mutants defined in the mutation input file)
    - g_to_i_ : tests for GASright looking at g to i mutation data including other mutations (ex: x_to_a)
    - percentWT_lessThan_ : contains the percent of mutants that are less than the given percentWT value
    - maltose_passing: available for some runs; contains sequences that have maltose scores > -99.99 (arbitrary cutoff) and 
     less than 99999900 (signifies that sequence not found in either LB or maltose sequencing, anything above is found in only LB);
     only compares the 12H LB to 36H maltose, none of the other timepoints.
 - graphed: contains graphs of the data in sequenceVsMutant titled directories by the names of the files
    - all of these use the sequence_fluor_energy_data.csv file found in the respective directories in the sequenceVsMutant directory
