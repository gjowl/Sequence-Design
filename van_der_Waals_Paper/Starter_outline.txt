Van der Waals packing facilitates membrane protein association

Abstract
    - Take from previously written stuff for now

Graphical Abstract
    - Have a nice figure of how my design algorithm works, maybe tie it into the figure 1 (extracted geometries),
      finally output the protein and show fluorescence

Intro
    - Look at other vdW and design papers to see how they structure this; Mravic et al. in particular
    - See how other papers pitch their work and if I can do that same
    - protein design as a tool to study protein-protein interactions
    - membrane proteins are difficult to study

Figure 1
    - Geometric landscape of membrane proteins (update this?)
    - Show how the protein is designed (maybe a nicer version of the flow chart, with a more detailed method in supplement?)
        - Can also add in the parts about confirming the structures with Rosetta or something else

Figure 2
    - Fluorescence from reconstruction explanation/cite the sort-seq paper
    - Distribution of all proteins just fluorescence (histogram/pie chart)

Figure 3
    - Energy score vs fluorescence data
        - correlation doesn't look good for all, but can I say something about the trends with the energy scores?
    - Unsure if I need all of the data, but maybe the clashing mutants at least
    - If I can get void mutant data, could also add that here

Figure 4
    - Converted fluorescence to biophysical deltaG vs total energy
    - If it looks okay, maybe the predicted vdW vs deltaG and other metrics?
