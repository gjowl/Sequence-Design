# files for writing down figure ideas for committee meeting

- add GpA and G83I to each dataframe, and then use those to plot the figures (can do this as an option, or within the dataframe which I think is easier)
- sankeymatic
- if time, highlighted "interfacial" residues in the structure from mutants and similar designs
- if time, make a figure of the structure with the mutations highlighted
- fix axes, colors, and labels on the figures
