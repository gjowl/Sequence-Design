This program is a test for analyzing next generation sequencing data post sort-seq. It will calculate and output
reconstructed fluorescence values for a given set of fastq files. There are stop gaps throughout the code if you
are interested in making changes, where it will not repeat (i.e. reconverting fastq to txt files).

1. Convert NGS fastq files to txt using a previously developed perl script
    - output into a directory using
2. Add all of that data to a csv file for easier manipulation
    - output as allCounts.csv. Can add other parts to this file, similar to how I wrote functions in main to add
    ids
3. Analyze data using the ngsAnalysis.py script, which will calculate and output the reconstructed fluorescence
    - calculates according to the reconstructed fluorescence equation (TODO add an image or file here)
