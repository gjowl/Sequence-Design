To run, copy into the command line from your directory of choice:
python3 main.py

Filenames must be in the below format:
For your bin files (C1=Bin1; Rep1=Replicate1). You can change these if you'd like,
but you'll have to switch up the code. As of 5/22/2022, it's currently hardcoded to
take and make files and columns for the outputs using the filename in this format. 
The LB and M9 files MUST be named with the hour number and H in order for the code
to recognize the hours and analyze it. For the analysis, these can be changed in the
config file (technically not yet, but they will be! Otherwise, just hardcoded in the
ngsAnalysis.py file)
-   C1-Rep1-...fastq
-   LB-0H-Rep1-...fastq
