GitHub Repository for files and data for designing membrane protein sequences 2019-2023

2023-2-27
Reorganized this directory to make it a bit more streamlined and easier to follow. 
Directories:
    - designAnalysisScripts: contains all of the scripts that have been used to analyze my designs, organized by year
    - 2022_designData: design data for prepping for a second CHIP run
    - 2022-2023_gblock: data from the gblock I ordered on 2022-11-20
    - 2023_proteinDesign: design runs for my second CHIP and the analyzed data
    - CHIP1_Analysis: analyzed data from my CHIP1
    - ngsReconstruction: fluorescence reconstruction of CHIP1, containing both data and code
    - PDB Scraping: functions that were used to analyze the data scraped from the membrane protein pdbs
    - IN PROGRESS:
        - CHIP1_reanalysis: after running rosetta on my CHIP1 sequences (and/or code that takes structures and repacks them), reanalyze them here
